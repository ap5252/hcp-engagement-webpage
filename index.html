        <p>
            My vision for HCP engagement and Speaker Bureau management is centered on an AI-powered handheld device designed to replace traditional leave-behind materials. This device will feature:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Generated Educational Videos:</strong> Personalized, concise video summaries generated by AI to educate HCPs on specific medications.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Resource Hub:</strong> Essential prescribing information, indications, labels, and other crucial resources at the touch of a button.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Registration and Management:</strong> View and register for upcoming programs directly through the device, streamlining the process and optimizing interactions with the sales team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This AI-driven device represents the future of HCP engagementâ€”a seamless, tech-driven extension of the sales rep that enhances every aspect of the interaction.
